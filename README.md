This is a simple web application that allows users to view job openings and submit applications for those jobs. Users can also view their past applications and edit or delete them if needed.

Super users have additional privileges, including the ability to add new job openings and delete existing ones.

Getting Started
To use this application, simply navigate to the website and create an account. Once you have created an account, you will be able to view available jobs and submit applications.

Usage
Once you are logged in, you will see a list of available jobs on the home page. To view more information about a job, simply click on the job.

To apply for a job, click on the job tou want and you will be taken to a page that has the application form and all about the job. You will be asked to fill that form with some basic information about yourself.

To view your past applications, click on the "My Applications" link in the navigation menu. From there, you can view your past applications, edit them, or delete them.

Super users can add new job openings by clicking on the "Add Job" button on the home page. They can also delete existing job openings by clicking on the "Delete" button next to the job title on the home page.
